/*
 * This module is responsible for showing the spoof commit warning banner on
 * the commit details page.
 *
 * This banner is displayed if the commit is not reachable from any named ref,
 * to warn the user that they may be looking at a commit from another fork of
 * the repo.
 *
 * We indicate that the commit is unreachable by including an element with the
 * ID `js-spoofed-commit-warning-trigger` in the page, instead of links to the
 * branches and tags that the commit belongs to.
